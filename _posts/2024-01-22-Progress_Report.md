This blog somehow turned into a half baked book. I need to finish this train of thought first.

This is just a way to keep myself a little bit accountable and to brag a little bit about how many ideas I have and how many end up being published. The expectation is that I will update this post and simply redate it. The information here is non-binding and prone to being out of date.

Stages:

Notes: Just a bunch of keywords of sentences describing the general idea of the blog post. Zero guarantee of being published.
Writing: Currently in the process of being written. May be unfinished and may take month long breaks even after the post is almost complete.
Verification: Most likely complete. Need to check if the numbers, etc are accurate.
