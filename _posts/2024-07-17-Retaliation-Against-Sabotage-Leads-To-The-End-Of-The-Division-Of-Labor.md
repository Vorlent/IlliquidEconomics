title: Retaliation Against Sabotage Leads To The End Of The Division Of Labor
---

>Problem: You can't make any profit in a fair exchange (that was the whole point of chapter 2), and you can't generally make profits by coming out ahead in unfair exchanges. (As we'd now say, that's at most zero-sum.) So where does "surplus value" come from? [0]

I am of the opinion that given the utilization of money, the exchange process is inherently imbalanced and asymmetric, with the person having money to spend being the one having the upper hand, simply because they can choose among many options, meanwhile the person selling has to guess exactly what to produce. Money buys many things, but there is only one thing that ends up buying the money.

A common argument against this is that if the money holder uses his money to buy something, he exposes himself to being sabotaged in the exact same way, so that if both parties defect, they will sabotage each other to the exact same degree and therefore nobody ends up better off. Person A produces bread and Person B produces milk. Person A buys milk for $10 and Person B buys bread for $10. Where is the sabotage? It obviously doesn't exist! In fact, this is just a competitive equilibrium! It just works!

However, what if one party tries to maximize the sabotage to get an edge? As usual, Person A produces bread and buys milk for $10. Person B refuses to buy anything except honey. From an outside perspective, Person A is the winner and the saboteur and Person B a virtuous saver. After all, Person A bought something without selling anything. The ultimate free lunch! ... but only if Person A wants to end the division of labor. Down with Person A!!!

If Person A wishes to continue the division of labor, then the wheel of time keeps turning. The bread goes stale. There are real costs incurred with the production of the bread and the subsequent inability to sell bread and the lack of knowledge that Person A should produce honey.

Person A remembers this, but proceeds with the speculative production process until Person A produces the actually wanted product (honey), then the honey has to be priced so that it compensates the costs of all the failed experiments in the path toward producing honey. Person B truly got what he deserves.

However, since Person B dictates what a failure is, the cost is in principle unbounded. Therefore, it is difficult to imagine how Person A could get back at Person B other than by raising the price of honey above its production cost, which Person B could refuse. So Person A sells the honey for a "reasonable" price.

To get even, Person A would have to keep a tally of all the failed experiments and costs associated with them and then perform the exact same strategy that Person B followed. Now that Person B bought something from A, Person A has the money and can perform the same extractive strategy to break even. Person A was neither a capitalist nor a worker, but simply a person that wants to transact.

So what does Person A do? He just buys milk and the extraction game continues anew by Person B, but this time Person B decides he wants butter. At some point Person A will learn a thing or two. Person A might not just want to get even for the last time he bought milk, in fact, Person A might want to break even since the first day he bought milk.

So Person A becomes a rentier, just the same way Person B acted as a rentier. However, Person B has played this game longer than anyone else and knows a thing or two. The trick is quite simple. Person B is ahead in the game and therefore merely has to do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to stay ahead. The division of labor has ended. The sabotage is complete. Farewell stranger.

Of course, the problem with this, is that it is a disequilibrium situation that quickly leads to the end of the economy. This is at odds with the present observation of an economy that, indeed, exists and continues to exist. The situation has to be adjusted slightly. If Person B acts as a rentier, then the amount of rent extracted leaves Person A on the edge of deciding to retaliate and losing the benefits of the division of labor and continuing the game and letting oneself be extracted.

How much can rentiers get away with? Surprisingly, if money is a transaction cost saving medium, then in principle all transaction cost saving benefits of money can be extracted. To be more precise, the transaction cost saving benefits versus the next best alternative. If there are two money systems and one designed to be free of rent extraction, but with a lesser ability to save transaction costs, then the difference between the better and worse money system is the amount of rent that can be extracted. Note how money behaves as a transaction technology exactly as Marx predicts capital to behave and yet he vehemently denies this to be the case.

The above scenario assumed that the division of labor is optional, but what if it in fact has become mandatory? The iterated prisoners dilemma turns into an iterated game of chicken. The benefits of continuing the division of labor are considered the zero reference point, not to imply that it doesn't have any value, but to imply that things can only get worse.

In the game of chicken, the idea is that both players drive a car toward one another and swerve at the last moment. The first person to swerve is considered the coward and experiences a reputational loss and the winner of the game experiences a reputational gain for being brave. If the coward decides to retaliate and nobody swerves, the end result is a catastrophic outcome.

Now you might argue that this situation is outlandish. Not only can exploitation happen only by ending the game and thereby the economy, but more importantly: nobody in the real world is actively trying to sabotage money in the way described above. One reason is the fact that there are only two parties involved and the relationship is inherently bidirectional, so that the threat of retaliation is immediately obvious. In a three person economy, there can be unidirectional economic activity, which prevents direct retaliation.

* Person A produces bread and buys milk from Person B.
* Person B produces milk and buys honey from Person C.
* Person C produces honey and buys bread from Person A.

If Person B decides to act as an adversary and refuses to buy honey from Person C and instead demands the speculative production of a non revealed product, then Person C cannot retaliate against Person B as Person C does not buy from Person B. It simply isn't possible for the sabotage of Person C by Person B to be directed back. Instead, Person C must sabotage Person A and Person A must sabotage Person B.

Suddenly the economy has become significantly more complicated. In fact, due to the nature of indirect interactions, one person deciding to perform sabotage leads to all participants performing sabotage. However, even in this more complicated scenario, unless the division of labor is ended, there is the expectation that everyone loses exactly as much as they gain from the sabotage. The point still stands though. A person being sabotaged will have to deflect that sabotage back to the rest of society to maintain something akin to a cosmic karma.

Going back to the game of chicken. If winner and loser switch their positions equally, then it is pretty obvious that no one will get an edge in the game. However, what if there was a way to avoid switching positions? There is. From the perspective of the neoclassical economist it will look like one side is unfairly benefitting and they end up dead wrong. 

What if Person A buys milk and Person B lends his money back to Person A to buy more milk? For the neoclassical economist, Person B is a virtuous person giving away milk to Person A, who is lazy and unmotivated and living in the moment. Person A borrows $100 and buys milk for 10 days with 10% interest per day. Poor Person B, how much consumption did you have to forego? Yet all you get is a paltry 10% interest.

Notice how the situation changes in the presence of debt. Since Person A must pay off the debt using income earned from selling to Person B, Person B can simply refuse to accept any product that Person A produces and gain a permanent income stream in the form of interest.

Let's say that Person B spends his $10 of interest on buying bread from Person A. Person A complains and argues, "hey I want to pay off my debt by $10 and stop paying interest, please buy $20 of products from me". Person B can simply refuse. In fact, Person B is in control of how much debt Person A has. If Person B buys nothing, then the debt will baloon to $110, $121, $133 and so on.

You might argue that everything is alright, since Person B has to forgoe consumption and therefore Person A should obviously become forever debt bonded to Person B. So, how exactly is Person A supposed to retaliate? The only thing Person A can do is not pay the debt. If Person A does not pay the debt, then why would Person B sell anything to Person A? There will be no more milk. The division of labor ends yet again.

For Person A, it makes sense to stay indebted as long as the interest expenses do not exceed the transaction cost saving benefits of the money that was borrowed. Since the transaction saving benefits of money can be monetized, any investment must exceed or equal the rent extracted through this scheme. There will be a positive return constraint in the economy. There will be capitalism.

Of course there is one more inconsistency. In the above scenario, the economic participants did not act simultaneously but sequentially. One person has to act first and that makes that person act with imperfect knowledge about the economy. If the neoclassical solver is used, everyone acts simultaneously and takes into account the behavior of everyone surrounding them. This results in a somewhat paradoxical situation. The division of labor is only performed in the cases where either no one performs sabotage, the sabotage is perfectly symmetrical or only the benefits of trade are siphoned. In all other cases, not even the initial trade is performed. The division of labor is never even attempted. Neoclassical economists simply ignore disequilibrium situations even if they must exist temporarily.

I hope this blog post made it clear that asymmetrical exchange relationships require increasingly implausible arguments to maintain the idea that there is no net sabotage, through the argument that everyone is sabotaging the other party equally, possibly aided by the creation of a hidden perfect central plan so that every participant is aware of how much sabotage is present in the system.

Most of the scenarios end with trade no longer being performed to reach the supposed net zero sabotage state, yet if one party acts before the other, there will be one sided residuals that benefit one at the expense of another. Moreover, the potential for sabotage is bounded by the benefits conferred by money and the division labor as that is the tipping point which makes people decide between trading and not trading.

Note how it is possible with the concept of sabotage to simultaneously both benefit and be exploited in capitalism. What this means is that the Communist critique of Capitalism only having downsides is wrong. In fact, for exploitation to persist over long periods of time, the saboteur has to somehow avoid retaliation, his sabotage must by definition remain incomplete.
